=============

There are two subdirectories here:

- legacy versions : older versions of the code that predate storage in git:
	- v0.90-sdl : my original C++/SDL based version.  Targets Windows and Nokia Maemo-based devices (N800, etc.)
	- v1.00-xna : my updated C#/XNA version.  Targets mainly Windows (and XNA-compatible versions of Windows Phone)
- v1.00-monogame-mp : my current base version.  Based on C# and Monogame (instead of XNA).  The primary goal of this version is to add online multiplayer support.
